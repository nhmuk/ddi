In 2022 the AI & Innovation team was established within the Digital, Data and Informatics theme\* to provide machine learning expertise to accelerate NHM research and digitisation programmes.

## Our Mission

Through harnessing today's data science and AI revolution, we can accelerate a pathway towards the Natural History Museum's goals and help unlock the potential of its collections and science.

Our efforts focus on three key areas:

1. Advancing rates of digitisation through machine-augmented data extraction and robotics.
2. Automation of real-time species monitoring and identification.
3. Building a planetary knowledge base, a graph of life constructed from collections and literature.
