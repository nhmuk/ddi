As an enabling theme within NHM Science, DDI actively supports scientific research and secures the future of our collections. We are comprised of four core teams: Digitisation, Data management, Data platforms & engineering and AI & innovation. Our various disciplines work together across the whole end-to-end "data lifecycle" of our museum collections, from physical objects right through to entries on the public Data Portal.
